#Child in Time
Child in Time is a desktop stand-alone application, made to measure the
motorial progress of students.

In the past, teachers have struggled to keep all the measured data in one
place. Papers with recorded data often got lost or were really unorganized.
This application aims to take away those struggles, and provide the teachers a
way to keep the data in one centralized place. This way, the teachers have more
time to give the students special care, or prepare better lessons.
